###About me  

An aspiring frontend developer who is ready and able to learn. 
My goal at this stage is to gain experience in working with git, 
javascript by performing test tasks, to deepen my knowledge in this area, 
and also to develop softskills. I love learning, I have been learning all my life  
and I believe that only by learning something new for myself, 
a person grows as a person.
