  ### About me  

An aspiring frontend developer who is ready and able to study. 
My goal at this stage is to gain experience in working with git, 
javascript by performing educational projects, to deepen my knowledge in this area, 
and also to improve soft skills. I like studying, I have been studying all my life  
and I believe that only by studying something new for myself, 
a person grows as a person.
